					<p class="title">I love to code.</p>
					<p class="pageDescription">
						I started programming in the fourth grade with Interplay&apos;s Learn To Program Basic, and have never looked back.  During the summer after seventh grade, I began attending Camp CAEN at the University of Michigan, an extremely challenging residential computer camp sponsored by U of M&apos;s engineering department, where I took classes on C#, C++, Java, HTML/CSS, Javascript, PHP, Web Design, and even 3D Modeling.  When I was in high school, I went back to Camp CAEN working as a counselor-in-training, taking on duties of assisting in the teaching process and helping students with their questions.  After graduating high school, I moved to Utah to attend Neumont University, attracted by their extremely intense and fast-paced learning environment.  I graduated college with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree at age 20.  I immediately entered the industry, and am currently happily employed as a software engineer at 1-800 Contacts working for their e-commerce team.
