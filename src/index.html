				<p>
					I love to code.  I started programming in the fourth grade with Interplay&apos;s Learn To Program Basic and never looked back.  During the summer after seventh grade, I began attending Camp CAEN at the University of Michigan where I took classes on C#, C++, Java, HTML/CSS, Javascript, PHP, Web Design, and even 3D Modeling.  When I was in high school, I went back to Camp CAEN working as a counselor-in-training, taking on duties of assisting the teaching process and helping students with their questions.  After graduating high school, I moved to Utah to attend Neumont University because of their high rates of graduate job placement, only 2.5 year graduation schedule, and enterprise projects.  I graduated college when I was 20 and immidiately entered the industry.  I am currently happily employed working at Towers Watson for their Exchange Solutions branch.
